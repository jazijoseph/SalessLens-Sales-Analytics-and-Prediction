RevenueLens – Sales Analytics & Profit Optimization

RevenueLens is a strategic analytics project designed to evaluate discounting strategies and forecast revenue while preserving profitability.

It moves beyond raw revenue growth to answer a critical business question:

Are we growing profitably  or just growing?

 The Business Challenge

Aggressive discounting increased sales volume, but leadership lacked clarity on margin sustainability.

The objective was to:

Quantify discount impact on profitability

Forecast revenue under current strategies

Provide governance-aware recommendations

 Approach

Time-based train/test split (no data leakage)

Regression-based forecasting model

Evaluation using RMSE & MAPE (~10%)

Residual diagnostics (random, unbiased errors)

Scenario testing for strategic discount optimization

 Key Findings

Blanket discounting reduces margin efficiency.

Higher revenue ≠ higher profitability.

A slightly less aggressive but optimized discount strategy improves long-term stability.

Clean residual diagnostics indicate reliable model structure.

 Business Impact

This project reframes decision-making from:

“Maximize volume”
to
“Balance volume and margin strategically.”

It demonstrates how data storytelling can guide executive-level financial decisions.

 Tools Used

Python • Pandas • Statsmodels • Scikit-learn • Matplotlib
